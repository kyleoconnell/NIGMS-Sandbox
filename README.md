# **National Institute of General Medical Sciences Cloud Learning Modules**


# Introduction

This repository aims to teach students, researchers, and clinicians, among others, how to utilize the power of cloud technology for the benefit of life sciences applications and research. Here we present 12 cloud learning modules that represent a unique use case or scientific workflow. Types of data used across the modules include but are not limited to genomics, methylomics transcriptomics, proteomics, and medical imaging data across formats such as FASTA/FASTQ, SAM, BAM, CSV, PNG, and DICOM. Learning modules range in areas from introductory material to single-omics approaches, multi-omics techniques, single cell analysis, metagenomics, and AI/ML imaging applications. 

To run these modules you will need a Google Cloud Project. For beginner friendly information on Google Cloud, visit the [NIH Cloud Lab GitHub](https://github.com/STRIDES/NIHCloudLabGCP) repository, which also includes a set of helpful [Google Cloud tutorials](https://github.com/STRIDES/NIHCloudLabGCP/tree/main).

## Resources 
In the below section we define the GCP services utilized across the learning modules. You can find an additional curated list of GCP tutorials in this repository under docs: [GCP Resources detailed](./docs/GoogleCloudPlatformResources.md)

### Google Cloud Platform resources <a name="gcp"></a>

1. **IAM - https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview** \
IAM in GCP allows you to manage access control by defining who (identity) has what access (role) for which resource. In IAM, permission to access a resource isn't granted directly to the end user. Instead, permissions are grouped into roles, and roles are granted to authenticated principals. 


2. **Billing - https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs** \
To use Google Cloud services, you must have a valid Cloud Billing account, and must link it to your Google Cloud projects. Your project's Google Cloud usage is charged to the linked Cloud Billing account. When you sign up for [NIH Cloud Lab](https://cloud.nih.gov/resources/cloudlab/) you will access an account loaded with credits for you to experiment with.


3. **Cloud Storage - https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/introduction** \
Cloud Storage is a service for storing your objects in Google Cloud. An object is an immutable piece of data consisting of a file of any format. You store objects in containers called buckets. All buckets are associated with a project, and you can group your projects under an organization. 


4. **Vertex AI - https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/introduction-unified-platform** \
Vertex AI brings AutoML and AI Platform together into a unified API, client library, and user interface. AutoML lets you train models on image, tabular, text, and video datasets without writing code, while training in AI Platform lets you run custom training code. With Vertex AI, both AutoML training and custom training are available options. Whichever option you choose for training, you can save models, deploy models, and request predictions with Vertex AI. Vertex AI implements JupyterLab in Vertex AI Workbench. 

5. **Cloud Build - https://cloud.google.com/build/docs** \
Cloud Build is a service that executes your builds on Google Cloud infrastructure. Cloud Build can import source code from Cloud Storage, Cloud Source Repositories, GitHub, or Bitbucket, execute a build to your specifications, and produce artifacts such as Docker containers or Java archives.


6. **Cloud Life Sciences API - https://cloud.google.com/life-sciences/docs/process-genomic-data** \
Cloud Life Sciences is a suite of services and tools for managing, processing, and transforming life sciences data. Cloud Life Sciences (formerly Google Genomics) enables the life sciences community to process biomedical data at scale. Cost effective and supported by a growing partner ecosystem, Cloud Life Sciences lets you focus on analyzing data and reproducing results.


7. **Operations (formerly Stackdriver) https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs** \
Operations, formerly known as Stackdriver, is composed of Monitoring and Logging. Cloud Monitoring collects metrics, events, and metadata from Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), hosted uptime probes, and application instrumentation. Using the BindPlane service, you can also collect this data from over 150 common application components, on-premise systems, and hybrid cloud systems. Google Cloud's operations suite ingests that data and generates insights via dashboards, charts, and alerts. BindPlane is included with your Google Cloud project at no additional cost.

Cloud Logging is a fully managed service that allows you to store, search, analyze, monitor, and alert on logging data and events from Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services. You can collect logging data from over 150 common application components, on-premises systems, and hybrid cloud systems.



## Alternative Data Sources <a name="data"></a>

Where can users get similar data to run through these tutorials with their own datasets or alternative datasets of interest? 

1. SRA \
Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data, available through multiple cloud providers and NCBI servers, is the largest publicly available repository of high throughput sequencing data. The archive accepts data from all branches of life as well as metagenomic and environmental surveys. SRA stores raw sequencing data and alignment information to enhance reproducibility and facilitate new discoveries through data analysis. Learn more about accessing SRA data through GCP from the [NIH Cloud Lab Tutorial Section](https://github.com/STRIDES/NIHCloudLabGCP/tree/main#download-data-from-the-sequence-read-archive-sra-). 

2. GEO \
GEO is a public functional genomics data repository supporting MIAME-compliant data submissions. Array- and sequence-based data are accepted. Tools are provided to help users query and download experiments and curated gene expression profiles. Learn more [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)

3. MEDMNIST \
The MedMNIST v2 dataset consists of 12 pre-processed 2D datasets and 6 pre-processed 3D datasets from selected sources covering primary data modalities (e.g., X-Ray, OCT, Ultrasound, CT, Electron Microscope), diverse classification tasks (binary/multi-class, ordinal regression and multi-label) and data scales (from 100 to 100,000). For simplicity, we call the collection of all 2D datasets as MedMNIST2D, and that of 3D as MedMNIST3D. MedMNIST can be downloaded through pip. Learn more [here](https://medmnist.com/)

4. Google Public Dataset Program - https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/public_datasets_one_pager.pdf \
Google Cloud Public Datasets facilitate access to high-demand public datasets making it easy for you to access and uncover new insights in the cloud. By hosting these datasets in BigQuery and Google Cloud Storage, you can seamlessly experience the full value of Google Cloud with the touch of a button. Explore public datasets stored in [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-public-data) and in [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data).
